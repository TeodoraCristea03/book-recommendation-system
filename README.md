The conducted study consists of applying 5 machine learning algorithms (collaborative filtering - item-based and user-based, matrix factorization, content based filtering and hybrid method) on the same database in order to compare their performance and choose the algorithm that provides the best book recommendations.

For the case study, I used a database that contains information about books available on Goodreads until the end of 2017. This database is public and can be accessed from the [UCSD Book Graph website] (https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home).
